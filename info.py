Today the world mourns the brutal and senseless lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker from Bhaluka in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, whose life was taken in a horrific act of mob violence. �
www.ndtv.com +1
Dipu was a hardworking young man, a tenant living away from home, and an employee at the Pioneer Knit Composite Factory in the Square Masterbari area of Mymensingh. He worked every day to support his family and build a future — until rumours and unproven allegations changed everything. �

On the evening of December 18, 2025, rumours began to spread that Dipu had allegedly made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet — a claim that official investigators later found no evidence for. �
Without any fair investigation or legal process, an enraged crowd formed around him. In a chilling display of brutality, the mob beat Dipu mercilessly, tied his lifeless body to a tree, and then burned him alive along the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway. His body was left there as traffic came to a standstill, and videos of the attack circulated on social media, shocking millions. �

Dipu was not just a number in the news — he was a living soul with family, hopes, and responsibilities: a son, a brother, and a young man striving for a better life. His death has sent shockwaves not only through Bangladesh but across the world. The incident has sparked widespread protests, outrage, and demands for justice, including demonstrations outside the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi, international condemnations, and urgent calls from human rights advocates calling attention to the vulnerability of minorities. �

Authorities have arrested several suspects connected to the lynching, but the pain remains. This brutal murder raises serious questions about religious intolerance, mob violence, and the safety of minority communities in modern society. �

🔹 Let this be a reminder:
No one should ever lose their life over rumours, fear, or hatred.
No religion, community, or person should live under constant threat.
Justice must be served, and peace must prevail. 🙏
